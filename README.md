This is my project. I wrote it, I maintain it, and I am the sole developer.
(well witgh some exceptions)

The source code is provided for reference only. It is not open for contributions.
Do NOT submit pull requests or make changes without talking to me first.

You are free to use DiagROM however you want, including commercially.
You may not distribute modified versions. Only my official releases are allowed.

The source code is made publicly available so that if something happens to me,

No lawyers, no legalese - just common sense and respect.

Instruction how to build this will come later.  All done in Linux.  even if windows is technically possible.
