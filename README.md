DiagROMV2

WHAT IS IT?

It is a diagnostic tool for the Commodore Amiga Computers.
it replaces the Kickstart ROM. (main operatingsystem, Bios or whatever you want to call it) and helps doing diagnostic of issues of the machine.
it requires still that you know a lot of the machine but can help in repairs.

output will also be done on serialport at 9600BPS 8N1   no handshake used
